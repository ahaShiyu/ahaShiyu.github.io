I'm a Ph.D. student in the Center for [Secure Information Systems (CSIS)](https://csis.gmu.edu/) at George Mason University with the supervision of [Dr. Kun Sun](https://csis.gmu.edu/ksun/). Before joining Dr. Sun's group, I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science with concentration in Security at Case Western Reserve University. My research interest focuses on program analysis and software security.
